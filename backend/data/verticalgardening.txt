Vertical Gardening
Vertical gardens are a great way to maximize limited space in urban settings. Hereâ€™s how you can create one:

Plant Selection: Climbing plants like ivy, beans, peas, and cucumbers work well.
DIY Structures: Use trellises, hanging planters, or wall-mounted pockets.
Benefits: Vertical gardens provide insulation for buildings and reduce indoor temperatures.
Tip: Ensure that the structure you use is sturdy and secure for growing plants.
