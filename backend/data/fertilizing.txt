**Fertilizing Plants**

1. When to Fertilize:
   - Spring: Most plants benefit from fertilization during their active growth phase.
   - Summer: Fertilize every 4-6 weeks during the growing season.

2. Types of Fertilizer:
   - Liquid Fertilizer: Best for quick nutrient absorption.
   - Slow-Release Fertilizer: Gradually feeds plants over time.

3. Common Mistakes:
   - Over-fertilizing: Too much fertilizer can burn the roots; always follow package instructions.
   - Fertilizing Dormant Plants: Avoid fertilizing during the winter months.
