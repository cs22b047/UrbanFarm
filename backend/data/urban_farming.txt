Urban environments often present challenges such as limited space, poor soil quality, and varying levels of sunlight. However, there are many plants that thrive in these conditions:

Succulents: Low-maintenance and ideal for small spaces.
Herbs: Basil, mint, rosemary, and thyme are great for windowsills.
Tomatoes: Compact varieties like cherry tomatoes grow well in containers.
Lettuce and Spinach: Fast-growing and suitable for small containers.
Ferns and Spider Plants: Perfect for shady urban spaces.
Tip: Choose drought-tolerant plants that can handle fluctuating watering schedules.
