Rooftop Gardening
Rooftop gardens are perfect for utilizing unused spaces in urban areas. Hereâ€™s what you need to know to get started:

Weight Considerations: Ensure your roof can support the additional weight by consulting a structural engineer.
Best Plants: Opt for lightweight plants such as herbs, succulents, and small vegetables.
Drainage: Install proper drainage systems to avoid water damage.
Wind Protection: Rooftops are windy, so use windbreaks or barriers to protect delicate plants.
Rooftop gardening helps improve air quality and reduces urban heat.
